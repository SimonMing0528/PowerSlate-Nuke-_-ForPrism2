# PowerSlate-Nuke / ForPrism2

A Nuke slate plugin developed using Prism2, a VFX project workflow management software, capable of displaying current shot version information within the frame (e.g., shot ID, version number, frame range, project naming, etc.). This facilitates daily progress checks, comparisons, and allows for shot review personnel to confirm version details efficiently during regular work tasks
